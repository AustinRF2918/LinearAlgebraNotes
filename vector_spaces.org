* Null Space
** Relation To Subspace
   We can note that Null *Space* includes the word space in it: This is
   because on top of being a *subset* of some 

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex
    \begin{equation}\mathbb{R}^n\end{equation} 
   #+END_SRC
   
   It also has the following attributes where *u* and *v* exist such that:
   #+BEGIN_SRC latex
     \begin{equation}A\vec{u} = \vec{0}\end{equation}
     \begin{equation}A\vec{v} = \vec{0}\end{equation}
   #+END_SRC

      Due to these facts we know

    #+BEGIN_SRC latex
     \begin{equation}A\vec{0} = \vec{0}\end{equation}
     \begin{equation}A\vec{u + v} = A\vec{u} + V\vec{v} = \vec{0} + \vec{0} = \vec{0}\end{equation}
     \begin{equation}cA\vec{u} = c\vec{0}\end{equation}
     which in turn means
     \begin{equation}cA\vec{u} = \vec{0}\end{equation}
     which also means
     \begin{equation}Ac\vec{u} = \vec{0}\end{equation}
   #+END_SRC

   These three facts are the definition of a subspace, therefore we have shown
   why the null space is, in fact, a subspace.
