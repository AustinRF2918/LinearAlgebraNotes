* Null Space
** Relation To Subspace
   We can note that Null *Space* includes the word space in it: This is
   because on top of being a *subset* of some

   It also has the following attributes:
   #+BEGIN_SRC latex
     Let vec{u}, vec{v} exist such that 
     \begin{equation}A\vec{u} = vec{0}\end{equation}
     and
     \begin{equation}A\vec{v} = vec{0}\end{equation}

     Due to these facts we know
     \begin{equation}A\vec{0} = vec{0}\end{equation}
     \begin{equation}A\vec{u + v} = A\vec{u} + V\vec{v} = vec{0} + vec{0} = vec{0}\end{equation}
     \begin{equation}cA\vec{u} = cvec{0}\end{equation}
     which in turn means
     \begin{equation}cA\vec{u} = vec{0}\end{equation}
     which also means
     \begin{equation}Ac\vec{u} = vec{0}\end{equation}

   These three facts are the definition of a subspace, therfore we have shown
   why the null space is, in fact, a space.
