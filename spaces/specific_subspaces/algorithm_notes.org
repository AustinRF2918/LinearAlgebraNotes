* Determining If A Vector *W* Is In A Column Space Of A
  Use a reduction algorithm on A <> *W*, observe
  if there is a free (all zero) row.

* Determining If A Vector *W* Is In A Null Space Of A
  Perform Operation A * *W*, observe output. If we 
  have null output, then we can be certain that it
  (*W*) is included in the null space.
